# MLB Data Acquisition

This repository contains R code for collecting the data on Major League Baseball (MLB), 
the Statcast pitch-by-pitch data on all regular season games for 2015-2019.
To collect the data, I utilize the R package "mlbr" (https://github.com/pontsuyu/mlbr). 


I also attach the list of variables and each variable's definition (Variable Definition.xlsx).



The file "Variable Definition.xlsx" contains the list of variables collected by "mlbr" and 
each variable's definition.
